# DataStore Project
## The Goal of Phase One
The goal of the Phase One is to convert Java objects into database tables. 
* An instance of a Java class is analogous to an item in a databsase table.
* A field of a Java class is an abtribute of an item.

## Java Persistence API (JPA) - There are three components to the Persisting Java Objects
### 1) Entity
* An entity takes the object and converts it into a database table and its details. 
* The PenachieEntity interface simplies the process of creating entities because it generates the boiler plate code automatically.
### 2) Repository
* A Repository encapsulate the database operations you can perform on entity objects. 
* It helps separate the logic from the database operations and improves the reusability of our code.
### 3) Routes
* An API route gets the specific and necessary information to accomplish a webpage.

#### Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) Opperations


### Hibernate 
* Hibernate is one of the most mature JPA applications - it is a form the JPA. 

There are three parts to file structure and api

### Our Paradigm
Our goal was to persistce user and group Java objects into user and group tables.
